# SwiftHelloWorldForWindows
Minimal project structure to build a HelloWorld swift executable for Windows.
This is inspired from [swift-win32](https://github.com/compnerd/swift-win32) and has been simplified to only keep what is required in order to build and run a HelloWorld executable. It does not contain any Swift wrapper for Win32 API.

## Instructions

### Setup
- Install Swift on Windows https://swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift

### Build
- Execute [build.bat](build.bat)
